## Information

Al Dente is a project developed during the 2nd year in the Web Information Systems and Technologies course for the Web Programming I subject at ESMAD. 
The main objective is to develop an app that allows users to make and manage reservations at ESHT's restaurant.
This app will lower food waste, make the processes of consulting, making and paying a reservation much easier, and allow for a convenient and informative way to get to know the school's restaurant.
